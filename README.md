# Litestar sphinx theme

A Sphinx theme for the [Litestar organization](https://github.com/starlite-api), based on the
[PyData Sphinx Theme](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme).

It doesn't do much, mostly adjusting some colours a bit of layout and add a few default links and menus.

Refer to the [PyData Sphinx Theme documentation](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for documentation.

**This theme is not intended for general use**
